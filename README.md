----------MAKE SURE YOU HAVE FIGLET AND LOLCAT INSTALLED!!----------

Sudo pacman -S lolcat (makes the text rainbow!)
Sudo pacman -S figlet (Cool tool that transfers normal text into ASCII!)

Once you have figlet and lolcat installed, open up your terminal and head into your bash (nano ~/.bashrc) and paste the text inside the "Mini Fastfetch" file. Make sure you save it!
